                    <p class="gingercovedescription">
                        Ginger Cove is an assisted living community in Annapolis, MD that houses 350 residents
                        of 60 years of age and older. Ginger Cove offers unique events daily and allows their
                        residents to pursue their personal interests.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ginger Cove wanted to reinvent the way they ran their programs. With many of their
                        record-keeping and event sharing on paper, they wanted to make things more convenient
                        by turning it digital and creating a mobile app. Furthermore, Wellness Director Alena 
                        Daily wanted the app to serve as a holistic wellness tracker, record the 
                        events the residents signed into and their emotional well being, and allow them to 
                        connect more with the Ginger Cove community online.

                            <li>Team came to agreement that XCode was ideal for iOS App Development</li>

                            <li>I was assigned to research the diary feature and photo feed.</li>
                            <li>Diary feature was approved while photo feature was decided to be a non-priority given our three month time frame.</li>

                            <li>Decided to use one font for simplicity and to differentiate the same font with parameters such as size,
                            weight, and color depending on information hierarchy and organization.</li>
                            <li>Blue - most likeable color, soothing, relaxing, and the most dominant color of Ginger Cove
                            <li>White - color of empty space & harmony; good for separating large chunks of info</li>
                            <li>Determined other UI elements like rounded corners of 10 for buttons, and a bright blue color for call-to-action buttons</li>

            <div class="mb-5">
                <h2>Challenges & Takeaways</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Working Remotely:</b> While building the design of this app, it was challenging to know everyone's style since
                    we have never met each other before. We were all undergraduate students hoping to build our skills during the summer of
                    quarantine. Additionally, we were given creative freedom to design it any way we liked as long as it had the features
                    that the CEO and Wellness Instructor specifically wanted. This means we had to set clear deadlines for ourselves for three
                    months, often meeting once to twice a week to present our progress to the Team Lead and determine the next set of deliverables. 
                    With everyone's varying summer schedules because of other work or summer courses, we were all at different points in the project. 
                    I took initiative to take on more tasks and inform the team of improvements and resources for suggestions.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Understanding the User:</b> As a critical part of creating a user-centered design, it was difficult to get feedback from
                    the residents of Ginger Cove. Communication with the residents was never direct: Our team lead would communicate to the
                    Wellness Coach, who would then communicate to the residents. Through the Wellness Coach, we had a survey sent out asking of
                    which wireframes they enjoyed the most, and included an area to leave feedback. However, only 5 residents responded. This made
                    it challenging to design for everyone.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Designing the high-fidelity prototype:</b> Although I had a basic understanding of how the app was supposed to look through 
                    the finalized user flow diagram and wireframe, it was more difficult to actually implement our ideas than expected. Getting the
                    team to fully understand the branding and smallest details of the UI was challenging because of our remote environment.
                    Secondly, this was everyone's first time using Adobe XD. I had to watch videos and read articles on how to design certain
                    aspects. I collaborated with the rest of the team on how to use features in Adobe XD that would make our work look more unified
                    and simple for our users. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>My first ever UI/UX Project:</b> This app was my first time working on a UI/UX design team. I got to dabble in 
                    learning about what the basic design process is, illustrating my first user flow diagram, making my first wireframe, and
                    building my first working prototype! It was so exciting to see screens flow together based on the vision we had in mind.
                    I have never touched Adobe XD before this experience, but I loved being able to play around with transitions and
                    movements between screens based on certain actions by the user. I learned that a lot goes into good design, which is
                    often something I take for granted. This experience has opened my eyes to see that there are so many details that go into making
                    the user experience pleasurable, and that even the smallest details make the biggest differences.</li>
